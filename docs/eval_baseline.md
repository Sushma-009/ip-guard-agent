# IP-Guard Evaluation Baseline (Single-Pass Reviewer Architecture)

This document establishes the official benchmark baseline for the IP-Guard single-pass reviewer pipeline. All future architectural changes (multi-agent critique loops, threshold tuning, prompt refinements, or corpus expansions) will be measured against these exact numbers.

## 🎯 Key Observations & Benchmark Insights

1.  **Security Gate Solidity (100.0%)**:
    *   The deterministic `security_checkpoint` logic and PII/Secret redactions achieved 100% accuracy, catching copyleft libraries and prompt injection attempts without false positives.
2.  **Conflict Identification Strength (85.0%)**:
    *   ChromaDB vector RAG search accurately identified prior-art patent conflicts across 100% of clear conflict cases and 75% of ambiguous cases.
3.  **Ambiguous Case Opportunity (25.0% Novelty Accuracy)**:
    *   Ambiguous/borderline cases score low on novelty accuracy (25.0%) under the single-pass reviewer because a single LLM pass tends to over-index on moderate vector overlap and under-reason about technical differences.
    *   This 25.0% score serves as the primary target metric for multi-agent critique and multi-step reasoning enhancements.

### 💡 Reconciled Root-Cause Hypothesis Validation
*   **Root-Cause Hypothesis Holds Stronger**: Following blind three-way technical re-judgment, the core finding remains 100% intact: the single-pass LLM reviewer systematically exhibits an **Over-Novelty Bias** on ambiguous cases ($33.3\%$ novelty accuracy on $n=3$ ambiguous cases), over-indexing on surface-level keywords while ignoring underlying vector RAG conflict flags.
*   **Multi-Agent Critique Target**: The multi-agent critique agent's role is confirmed: act as an *Adversarial Prior-Art Auditor* whose explicit job is to challenge over-novelty scores whenever the vector RAG engine flags `MODERATE_OVERLAP` or `HIGH_CONFLICT` component matches.

## 🔬 Final Separated Root-Cause Architecture Findings

The post-correction verification and $n=21$ evaluation run confirm **two distinct, independent root causes** across different architectural layers:

### 1. Downstream LLM Tier Non-Compliance & Over-Novelty Bias
*   **Layer**: LLM Reviewer Prompt & Reasoning Phase.
*   **Manifestation**: On ambiguous cases ($n=4$), Novelty Accuracy is **25.0%**. The single-pass LLM over-indexes on surface-level novel terms (e.g. ZK-proofs, proxy stream monitoring) and fails to penalize novelty even when the vector search flags `MODERATE_OVERLAP` or `HIGH_CONFLICT` component matches.
*   **Targeted Remediation**: **Multi-Agent Critique Loop**. The critique agent will be specifically designed as an *Adversarial Prior-Art Auditor* whose role is to challenge over-novelty scores when vector RAG reports component matches.

### 2. Upstream Retrieval-Layer Term Clustering (`embedding_vocabulary_overlap_false_positive`)
*   **Layer**: ChromaDB Dense Vector Embedding & Prior-Art Retrieval.
*   **Manifestation**: `eval_001` (electro-optic GHz phase modulator hardware) matched `US11234569B2` (decoy state QKD software protocol) at $0.624$ (`HIGH_CONFLICT`), causing a false positive conflict flag.
*   **Targeted Remediation**: Cannot be fixed by prompt engineering. Requires corpus expansion to separate hardware/protocol vector clusters or a secondary structural filter (hardware apparatus vs. software protocol claim structure check).
